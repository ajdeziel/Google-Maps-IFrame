#SENG 310 - Prototype Implementation
For use in Human Computer Interaction to deploy a customized Google Maps within a prototyping tool via an iframe.

As part of a group implementation project prototyping Crowdz; an application designed to measure the population density in specific locations to determine how occupied it is (i.e. lets users know how busy a restaurant/clinic/public place is in real time, and based on past trends).

Uses the Google Maps api to provide the scrollable map. The icons on the map are custom made, and are interactable. When clicked, the marker will have a content window show at the bottom of the screen that overlays the map. This is just a png image, and proto.io's functions emulate the interactions that would be included in the final version. The map is contrained to victoria. This was done to reduce the number of icons needed, which all had to be individually mapped.
